Graph coloring problem is to assign colors to certain elements of a graph subject to certain constraints.
Vertex coloring is the most common graph coloring problem. The problem is, given m colors, find a way of
coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are colored using same color. The other
graph coloring problems like Edge Coloring (No vertex is incident to two edges of same color) and Face Coloring
(Geographical Map Coloring) can be transformed into vertex coloring.
Chromatic Number: The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G is called its chromatic number.
For example, the following can be colored minimum 2 colors.
